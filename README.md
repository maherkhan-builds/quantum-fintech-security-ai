## The Problem

Quantum computers are advancing rapidly and may soon be capable of breaking widely used encryption standards such as RSA and ECC.

Financial institutions rely heavily on these encryption methods to protect:

- Transaction data
- Customer financial records
- API communications
- Blockchain signatures
- Cross-border payment systems

If quantum decryption becomes viable by 2030, banks and fintech platforms could face catastrophic financial data breaches and regulatory consequences.

Most institutions lack a clear framework to assess their quantum vulnerability or plan a structured migration strategy.

---

## The Solution

Quantum_Fintech_Security_AI is an AI-powered security assessment application designed to evaluate financial encryption risks against quantum threats.

The app:

- Assesses portfolio-level encryption exposure
- Identifies vulnerable cryptographic dependencies
- Recommends post-quantum encryption migration strategies
- Simulates secure transactions under different cryptographic models
- Provides actionable upgrade roadmaps

The goal is to help IT security teams transition from reactive security posture to proactive quantum readiness.

## Why This Requires a Purpose-Built App

General AI tools provide high-level advice, but quantum migration requires:

- Structured risk evaluation
- Encryption dependency mapping
- Migration sequencing logic
- Transaction simulation validation
- Performance benchmarking

A dedicated app enables financial institutions to model risk, test strategies, and implement structured quantum-safe transitions with clarity and control.
